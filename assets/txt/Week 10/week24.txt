    <strong><li>Favourites Functionality:</li></strong>
    <p>
        I was able to get the favourites functionality working which is exactly what I was hoping I would do. In figure 1 below, there is a screenshot of the cars page with buttons alongside each car row. When a user clicks on the heart, the car id is sent to the controller and their user id alongside the cad id is added to a joining table so that the car they like can be persisted and displayed at a later time on the favourites list page, see figure 2 below.
