	<h4><li>What did I do in the 30 minutes of this first lesson?</li></h4>
	<p>
		Since I decided to take the Introductory App Development paper in which I will learn how to use Laravel and Laragon, I was already equipped with the knowledge to create a basic 
		website template so I decided to move further ahead with the Laracast videos toward the more complicated stuff that usually comes later on. I browsed through the list to see 
		what seemed the most interesting and came across 3 videos:
		<br/>
			<ol>
				<strong><li><a href="https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch/episodes/5">Basic routing and views using laravel</a></li></strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							This video helped refresh my memory on how I would go about creating routes to different html pages using laravel. I learnt that routes are created within a web.php 
							file as references/pointers to the actual html file which is stored in a different location. This web.php file has knowledge of all the routes and when they are 
							requested by the user, laravel goes to the folder location in which the view is stored, finds it using the string name it has and pulls it up to be displayed.
						</li>
						<br/>
						<div class="border box centered" width="100%">
							<div class="border box inline" width="100%">
								<img class="image-centre" src="/assets/images/Week 1/Basic routing.png" alt="Image of basic routing using laravel" width="100%"/>
								<br/>
								<h6>Figure 1: Basic routing which returns a "test" view when the user navigates to the "test" url</h6>
							</div>
						</div>
					</ul>
				<br/>
				<strong><li><a href="https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch/episodes/6">Passing requests data to views</a></li></strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							This video was really useful because it taught me how to accept a request made by a user and pass it into the page's view so that is can be located and
							displayed to the respective page. This concept will become extremely useful in the future when I get into more complex web development requiring a user's input.
							Both images below illustrate the same concept, the only difference is that each image is a different way of going about executing the code to pass requests to views.
							In the image to the left, a variable can be declared and the request can be gathered from that point and then passed to the view that is to be displayed, whereas in 
							the image to the right,	the code is inlined meaning that the request is gathered and passed to the view in the same line of code that is used to display the view.
						</li>
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<div class="border box centered">
							<div class="border box inline pad">
								<img src="/assets/images/Week 1/Passing requests to views.png" alt="Image showing how to pass requests to views using laravel"/>
								<br/>
								<br/>
								<h6>Figure 2: Image showing how to pass requests to views using laravel</h6>
							</div>
							<div class="border box inline pad">
								<img src="/assets/images/Week 1/Passing requests to views (inline).png" alt="Image showing how to pass requests to views inline using laravel"/>
								<br/>
								<br/>
								<h6>Figure 3: Image showing how to pass requests inline to views using laravel</h6>
							</div>
						</div>
					</ul>
				<br/>
				<strong><li><a href="https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch/episodes/7">Route wildcards</a></li></strong>
				<ul>
					<li>
						I felt was the most important because it taught me how to setup a route to a webpage regardless of whether the page exists or not. This way, if a user enters an 
						invalid url, they are not met with an error that the page could not be found but instead can be redirected to a page that does exist and is valid.
					</li>
					<br/>

					<div class="border box centered" width="100%">
						<div class="border box inline" width="100%">
							<img class="image-centre" src="/assets/images/Week 1/Route wildcards.png" alt="Image showing how to use wildcards when routing in laravel" width="100%"/>
							<br/>
							<h6>Figure 4: Image showing how to use wildcards when routing in laravel</h6>
						</div>
					</div>
				</ul>
				<br/>
				<br/>
			</ol>

	<h4><li>Do I feel like I learnt something in the entirety of this first session?</li></h4>
	<p>
		I did feel like I had learnt something from this first lesson because I was able to do my own research and learn about an aspect of laravel that I was curious about 
		and not something that was scheduled to be taught. This way I could get more stuff done on my own and work at my own pace rather than at a lecturer's pace.
