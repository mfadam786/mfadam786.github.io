				I had fixed the username bug where users could edit their username to be the same as an existing user's username.

				I plan to get my features merged and check if any of my group members needed any assistance working on or fixing any functionalities they have been assigned.

		<strong><li><h4>Over the past 2 weeks, what has been getting in my way?</h4></li></strong>
		<ul>
			<li>
				I have a 50% assignment for another course which is close to being due, so I have noticed that I have been putting in less time to work on this project and more time towards that. I have also noticed my time management is starting to slack a little due to focussing mainly on this massive 50% assignment, but regardless of this, I was still capable of getting my tasks for this sprint done in time.
