    <strong><li>Email validation and verification:</li></strong>
    <p>
        At first I assumed this would also be quite a difficult task to get completed but again, as it turned out it was quite simple since Laravel has the built-in ability to send emails and all that needed to be done was that I had to configure our .env file with email host, port number and credentials in order to get emails sending. I also found a very handy tutorial on the official Laragon website which walked me through exactly how I would be able to set it up and get it working.

        <br/>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The first step was that I needed to navigate to Menu->Preferences->Mail Sender and add email credentials, i.e. username and password, I just created a brand new email for this project and used it to send emails.

                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                I then needed  to log in to the email I created and follow the link to turn on less secure apps which would allow laravel to use the credentials I gave it to send emails.
            </li>
            <li>
                Afterwards I just needed to configure the .env file to reflect the figure below and that would result in me successfully completing the email sending functionality I was assigned.

    <strong><li>Planning for users joining groups:</li></strong>
    <p>
        I thought about how the code would need to work step by step and made a little text file basically talking through what was supposed to take place and the order it was meant to occur in. Now that I have this plan, I feel confident that I will be able to get this functionality working if Isaac isn't able to get it working by our next meeting, which will be outside of class.
