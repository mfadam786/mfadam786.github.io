<h4 class="centered"><u>Client Meeting</u></h4>
<br/>
<p>
    This sprint, it was my turn to be the SCRUM master for this sprint so I went ahead and scheduled a meeting with our 
    client so that we could discuss what features and functionality he wanted by the end of the sprint. During the meeting, 
    we had gone over what each group member had completed in the previous sprint and demoed the working software for the 
    client to show him the progress we had made thus far. Once he was happy with our progress, we moved onto discussing what 
    we were required to complete by the end of this sprint. This was when we were told we'd be changing the entire theme of the site
    from video games to cars. Obviously its never good hearing from a client that they want to change up the entire theme
    of a project because it means you'd have to scrap what you've been working on and restart from scratch, <strong>but that
    was not the case this time...</strong>
    
    <br/>
    <br/>

    The client at this point in time did not have any specific requirements for this new site we were about to make and therefore
    gave us the freedom to do what we felt was necessary because he felt we were at a great point with the games site we worked on.
    All the client really wanted from my team and I for this sprint was to get the new cars site to the same standards as the games
    site as a good starting point before moving ahead and adding any new functionalities. We needed a site to reference and were told
    to refer to the <a href="https://www.autotrader.co.nz/">autotrader</a> website so that we could figure out what type of functionalities
    we needed in our website.

<br/>
<p>
    After the client meeting, as SCRUM master I felt that we needed to note down all of the functionalities we needed so we could easily figure 
    out how much work needed to be done. I referenced the autotrader site that we were meant to reference and looked for certain functionalities 
    that we could implement within our own site. I noted down some of the functionalities I thought our site needed so that we could turn them 
    into issues. Since we had already been through 3 sprints, each person in my group would have worked on a bunch of issues so I figured that 
    as each member worked to add

    <ul>
		<strong><li><h4>What have you completed since the last meeting?</h4></li></strong>
		<ul>
			<li>
				I had planned out a new database and some tables needed for our new cars website. After creating this plan, it gave me a clear idea of how the tables needed to look and what data needed to be in them so this made creating the tables and foreign key relationships quite quick.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		<strong><li><h4>What do you plan to complete by the next class?</h4></li></strong>
		<ul>
			<li>
				My plan is to now work on the ability to like/favourite cars and then viewing all favourited cars.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		<strong><li><h4>What is getting in your way?</h4></li></strong>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Having to wait for other group members to have completed their functionalities before I can begin with my functionality. Unfortunately there isn't much I can do until Isaac completes his CRUD functionality for cars because my favourites feature relies on his car CRUD features being completed. 
			</li>
