		During this session, I had learnt about user stories, what their purpose is and why they are important when it comes to creating applications for customers or users. A user story is a description that is used by developers to track
		all of the key features that are required to complete an application. These user stories become particularly useful when it comes to figuring out exactly which features are of top priority in order to get the application to a workable 
		and functional state.
