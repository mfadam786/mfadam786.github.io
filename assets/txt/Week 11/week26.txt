<h4 class="centered"><u>Client Meeting</u></h4>
<br/>
<p>
    During our scheduled meeting with our client, we had gone over the features we had implemented during the previous sprint and demoed our project. 
    The client expressed that our functionality thus far was quite good. We then moved onto finding out what the client wanted us to have completed for this sprint. He requests:

    <br/>

    <ul>
        <li>a reviews page about cars which can be hardcoded because he doesn't mind.</li>
        <li>a contact us page</li>
        <li>the ability to find dealerships and filter cars by dealerships. This could include the use of the google api to get real life locations displaying on the page.</li>
        <li>that the profile functionality gets completed.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br/>

    Now that we had our tasks for the sprint, we thanked the client for his time and were off to begin delegating tasks for the new sprint.

<h4 class="centered"><u>Task Delegation:</u></h4>
<br/>
<p>
    Once we finished the client meeting, my group and I talked about how we would assign tasks. 

    <ul>
        <li>Sophie volunteered to work on the  reviews page and continue refining any styling that was needed</li>
        <li>Albie volunteered to work on the contact us page</li>
        <li>Isaac decided he'd work on the CRUD functionality for dealerships</li>
        <li>I was tasked with completing the user profiles feature</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<br/>

    <ul>
		<strong><li><h4>What have you completed since the last meeting?</h4></li></strong>
		<ul>
			<li>
				I had completed the viewing and updating of user profiles which meant that users could now edit their profile pictures. 
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		<strong><li><h4>What do you plan to complete by the next class?</h4></li></strong>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Currently there is a security issue where if users are allowed to edit usernames, they could possibly change their username to one that is already taken which is a breach in security because usernames are what our site currently uses to enable user logins. This means that they have to be unique.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		<strong><li><h4>What is getting in your way?</h4></li></strong>
		<ul>
			<li>
				I seem to be making up time once again because I am working quite quickly through my tickets as I am close to finishing the user profiles feature I was assigned. This made up time however is being directed towards a 50% django assignment that I have in another course. I feel that this assignment is more of a priority at this point in time because it is worth 50%, but in saying that, since my group and I were able to accomplish so much of functionality up until now, it gave me a little bit of leeway to work on other assignments outside of this project.
