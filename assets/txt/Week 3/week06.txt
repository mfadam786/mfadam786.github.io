    This week kicked off the start of the semester long web application project which my group and I needed to create using the user stories we had come up with in the previous lesson. 
    Since we had already organised the user stories by priority, we now needed to figure out who was going to complete the respective application features. This was when we as a group 
    decided to figure out where our strengths and weaknesses lay. We picked a handful of features to complete, and thereafter found out from each group member which ones they would feel 
    the most confident being able to complete.
