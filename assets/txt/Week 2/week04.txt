		During this session, I had learnt about user stories, what their purpose is and why they are important when it comes to creating applications for customers or users. A user story is a verbal description of one or many features from the 
		perspective of an end user that an application is required to have. It is therefore used by developers to track all features that are required by an application. These user stories are particularly important when it comes to figuring 
		out exactly which features are of top priority in order to get the application to a workable and functional state. As you can see in figure 1, there is an example of a user story I had written as my team and I brainstormed user stories 
		for features we needed in the upcoming project we were going to start in the next lesson.
