<p>
    During the showcase, we had demoed our project to the entire class to show the work we had done all throughout the sprint thus far. Although we spent our time going through and making sure bugs were fixed in the previous sprint, there were still some issues that we had overlooked. One of those issues was my favourites feature which was now broken after deployment. When a user went to like/favourite a car, the page would throw an error. After a whole lot of working on it, I had finally understood that the reason my functionality was broken is because when I was inserting data into the favourites joining table, I had forgotten to specify a primary key in the joining table and this was causing a major issue when the heroku database tried to insert data into the table. Once I added a primary key to the table and model it fixed everything. The other issue that was noticed was that when a manufacturer was deleted, the cars that belonged to that manufacturer remained rather than being deleted. At first I thought this was incorrect but as it turned out, it was the way that I had designed the database. I had made cars independent records rather than tieing them to a manufacturer which meant that even though a car's manufacturer would be deleted, it would not mean that the car would get deleted.
