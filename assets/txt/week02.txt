		During this lesson, I had completed my first stand-up session in which each person in my group including myself was required to answer 3 questions,
        <br/>
        <ul>
            <strong><li>What have you completed since the last meeting?</li></strong>
            <strong><li>What do you plan to completeby the next class?</li></strong>
            <strong><li>What is getting in your way?</li></strong>
        </ul>
		<br/>

	<h4><li>Do I feel like I learnt something in the entirety of this first session?</li></h4>
	<p>
		I did feel like I had learnt something from this first lesson because I felt like I was able to do my own research and learn about an aspect of laravel that I was curious about 
		and not something that was scheduled to be taught. This way I could get more stuff done on my own and work at my own pace rather than at a lecturer's pace.
