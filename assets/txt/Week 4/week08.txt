				There was nothing left for me to work on since I had already completed all of my assigned functionality last week. This meant that I was left checking if my group members needed any assistance
                with any of their features, but ofcourse they had everything under control so there wasn't anything left for me to do.

				After demoing the completed registration and login functionality to Grayson, he decided on the spot that logging in with a users email address is quite a long winded task and instead I should
                change that to allowing users to log in using their username. Since this new feature was suggested by 'the client', I plan to have the ability for users to login using their username done by
                the next class.

                Not having any tasks to complete:

                    <li>
                        Because I am completing my tasks at a speedy pace, I feel as though I am wasting time doing nothing just because all my designated features have been completed. Knowing myself, I feel
                        I am much more productive when I have tasks that challenge me as this forces me to constantly want to get something's completed and working. This way  I am more likely to work on the 
                        task continuously and I can then space it out in order to get the task completed. 
                    </li>

				I had completed the functionality which enables users to login using a username instead of an email address, see figure below.

				Seeing as though this is the end of the sprint, there isn't any new features that I am allowed to implement until the start of the next sprint. Instead, I plan to make sure that I merge all
                of my features and pull requests into the dev branch to ensure it is ready for the stand-up/showcase meeting in the next class.

				I am currently quite on track, both with time management and efficiency of completing assigned tasks, so again, I feel there isn't anything getting in my way just yet.
