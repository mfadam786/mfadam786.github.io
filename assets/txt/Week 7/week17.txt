    <strong><li>Deciding which button to display:</li></strong>
    <p>
        When I first tackled this, I needed to figure out what button to show the current logged in user based on whether they had joined a group or not. I saw myself logging the data to make it easy for me to track and make sure that the code was working the way it was supposed to. I did this to ensure I was comparing the correct values when doing the if statement. I also displayed a join/leave button based on whether the if statement was true or false, see the figure below. This was clearly not working out though because it was displaying multiple join/leave buttons. I therefore had to take a different approach but I was quite stumped for a little bit.

            <div class="border box inline pad" width="100%">

        </div>

        I decided to come up with a different solution to my problem of figuring out if a user was part of a group already. What I have done is I have created an array and initialized it with the string "false". This array acts as my default check array. Now when I do the check to see if a user is part of a group, the value will change to "true". Now I can just loop through this array on the page and if the string is "true" display the leave button, otherwise display the join button. This method is far more simpler and efficient so I can't understand why I did not think of this in the first place.

    <strong><li>Users leaving groups:</li></strong>
    <p>
        The code to get users to leave groups was simple because all it involved was me having to remove the record where the group id in the joining table matched the group that the user clicked leave on. Looking back at this code now, I realise I have made a mistake because this will remove all groups that match and not the record pertaining to the current logged in user, meaning that all users that joined the group would get removed. This is a major problem which has now been resolved.
