	<strong><li>What did you do well?</li></strong>
	<p>
		I feel as though I managed my time quite efficiently throughout this sprint because I was able to complete all of my respective features and tasks within a short span of time.

	<strong><li>What barriers did you encounter?</li></strong>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				Since my functionality relied on other members having completed 
				I was unable to begin working on anything until other members of my group had completed their designated tasks.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Because we were planning on using our games site as a starting point, this meant most of the functionality 
			was already there and all we would need to do was change up a few things like :
			
			<ul>
				<li>create a new database so that it can hold information about cars</li>
				<li>convert the games and groups functionalities to align it with the new cars theme</li>
				<li>update the colour scheme</li>
				<li>Convert joining of groups functionality to favouriting functionality</li>
			</ul>

			<br/>

			Since most of the functionality I had done across previous sprints, like the login/registration and email verification,	
			was already part of this new project, this meant that it left me with not much individual work I could contribute towards this sprint.
