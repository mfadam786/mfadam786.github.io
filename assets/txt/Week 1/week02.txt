<h2 class="centered">Vendor Files Missing Research :</h2>
<br/>
<p>
	After running into all of those errors in class today when cloning our recently created Laravel application, I realized it may be an issue that will constantly arise throughout the semester so I decided to go off
    and find out what could be causing the issue. After doing some research I came to the understanding that the vendor folder ends up being gitignored which means it does not get backed up to github. Therefore when we clone
    the project, the vendor files along with all the project dependencies are missing and therefore need to be reinstalled.
