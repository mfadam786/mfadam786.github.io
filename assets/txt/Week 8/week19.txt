    <strong><li>Add New Highscore:</li></strong>
    <p>
        Since completing the functionality for users joining and leaving groups, the next thing was to allow users to add highscores which was quite simple. I used Isaac's previous CRUD features as a template to create the CRUD functionality for the highscores. Now when a user joins a group, the will see the button which will allow them to create a new highscore. They will then be redirected to a form to enter a score, see figure 1 below, which will get added to a joining table.

    <strong><li>Users joining groups:</li></strong>
    <p>
        Since I had already come up with a plan of how I was going to approach this problem, I methodically stepped through my plan line by line which made completing this piece of code quite quick and simple. In the figure below, when a user clicks on the join group button on the webpage, the groups’ information is then passed into the controller as you can see below. I then extract the groups’ id and get the id of the logged in user. These 2 id values are quite important because it allows me to make a link between a user and a group to symbolise that a user is part of a group. This data is then added to the groups table which is a joining table that holds all the information pertaining to which users are a part of which groups. The user is then redirected to the index page displaying all the available groups, in case the user wants to view or join another group.

        After the user submits their score, their user id, the group they are a part of and the score they entered will be used to create a record in a highscores table, see figure 2 below. Once this record is created and saved, the user is then redirected to the groups index page. I haven't yet added the ability to view these highscores but that will be my plan for the next sprint.
