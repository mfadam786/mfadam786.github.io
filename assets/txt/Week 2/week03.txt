		During this lesson, I had completed my first stand-up session in which each person in my group including myself was required to answer the following 3 questions:
        <br/>
        <ul>
            <strong><li><h3>What have you completed since the last meeting?</h3></li></strong>
			<ul>

					During the previous lesson, my group and I were running into a bunch of internal server errors whenever we had tried to view the laravel app in the browser (see figure 1).
					Since we could not progress without fixing this issue, I had gone off in search of the answer and surely enough, I had figured out how to fix the internal server 
					errors that we all were experiencing when trying to run the app. The is one of 2 ways to fix the errors:

					<ol>
						<li>
							The first way is to use the terminal and change directory to the root folder containing the application files and then run the commands 
							<ul>
								<li>"composer install"</li>
								<li>"npm install"</li>
								<li>"cp .env.example .env"</li>
								<li>"php artisan key:generate"</li>
							</ul>
							Essentially what these commands do is reinstalls all the missing composer and npm dependencies needed to run the application using localhost, then a copy  
							of the .env.example is made and saved as .env, and finally the missing keys are then generated so allowing the application to run using the localhost address.
						</li>
						<br/>
						<li> 
							The second way is to copy and paste the vendor folder back into the main app directory
							and then rename the .env.example file to .env which when run in the browser would force the user to generate the keys that were missing. Thereafter the page could
							be reloaded and it would start working once again.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<br/>
					
					Both methods work and accomplish the same task at the end of the day, but in my opinion I feel the second method is much easier because there is no need to remember 
					specific commands. Since the method of execution is simple to understand, this makes it my preferred choice for any future server errors that may arise.
