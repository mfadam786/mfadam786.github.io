		During this session, I had learnt about user stories, what their purpose is and why they are important when it comes to creating applications for customers or users. A user story is a verbal description of one or many features from the 
		perspective of an end user that an application is required to have. It is therefore used by developers to track all features that are required by an application. These user stories are particularly important when it comes to figuring 
		out exactly which features are of top priority in order to get the application to a workable and functional state. As you can see in figure 1, there is an example of a user story I had written as my team and I brainstormed user stories 
		for features we needed in the upcoming project we were going to start next week.

		My team and I had used a web application created by the previous semester's software engineering students (<a href="http://mariadb.ict.op.ac.nz/~se19s2_02/op-stats-mikrosoft/Software%20Engineering%20Project/public/">Mikrosoft Gaming</a>)
		to figure out some of the user stories we would need. After spending this lesson brainstorming my group and I came up with a bunch of features we think will be vital to the upcoming projects' success, see figure 2 below. Even though 
		we spent the lesson thinking about all of the possible features we would need to implement, we realised that we were bound to overlook a few features we would need to have so we figured that if we came across
