    <strong><li>Login and Registration Functionality:</li></strong>
    <p>
        Since Albert and I decided to peer program and get the login and registration functionality working, this meant that we both needed to be in the same place at the same time in order to get started
        with it. At this point, it was thursday and most of week 1 had gone but we had not done any work towards getting our login and registration functionality started. I tried contacting Albert at this 
        point, both on Microsoft teams and Facebook Messenger (see Figure 1 and Figure 2), so that we could meet up and work on our task together but I could not get a hold of him until 2 hours later. By then, 
        I had already completed both the login and registration functionality because I figured if I wait for the time in which we both are in the same room together to work on it, our group members and the 
        SCRUM master would wonder why no progress had been made to the features we had chosen to undertake.

    <strong><li>Database Design and Creation:</li></strong>
    <p>
        The next task I had undertaken was to create the database so that we could hold all of the key information for the project. The main reason a database is crucial when working with web applications is 
        the need for persistent data, meaning data that is permanent and that can be accessed at any and all times when using the application. I have undertaken this task because in the previous semester, I 
        had taken the Databases 2 paper which provided me with the necessary knowledge about databases, such as deciding what data to store, how to reduce duplication of stored data, and how to create and work
        with a database I create, thereby allowing me confidently create a database for our project.
        
        <br/>
        <br/>

        The first step was to model what the database should look like giving me an overview of all of the tables I would need and information those tables would hold. In figure 5, you will see a screenshot of 
        the database I have modelled using an online tool called <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Lucidchart&oq=Lucidchart&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59j0l2j69i60l4.1812j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Lucidchart</a>.
        Now that I have a model of what the database is meant to look like, it was time to create the actual database for the project.

        After following along with the laravel tutorials we had been given to use, I had come across a the database access section which outlined exactly how
