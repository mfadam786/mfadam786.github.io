<h4><li>What did I do in the 30 minutes of this first lesson?</li></h4>
<br/>
<p>
	Since I am taking the Introductory App Development paper, I was already equipped with the knowledge on how to create a basic website template 
	so I decided to move further ahead with the Laracast videos toward the more complicated stuff that usually comes later on. I browsed through the list to see what 
	seemed the most interesting and came across 3 videos:
	<br/>
		<ol>
			<strong><li>Basic routing and views using laravel</li></strong>
				<ul>
					<li>
						This video helped refresh my memory on how I would go about creating routes to different html pages using laravel. I learnt that routes are created within a web.php 
						file as references/pointers to the actual html file which is stored in a different location. This web.php file has knowledge of all the routes and when they are 
						requested by the user, laravel goes to the folder location in which the view is stored, finds it using the string name it has and pulls it up to be displayed.
					</li>
				</ul>
			<br/>
			<strong><li>Passing requests data to views</li></strong>
				<ul>
					<li>
					This video was really useful because it taught me how to accept a request made by a user and pass it into the page's view so that is can be 
					displayed to the respective page. This concept will become extremely useful in the future when we get into more complex web development requiring a user's input.
					</li>
				</ul>
			<br/>
			<strong><li>Route wildcards</li></strong>
			<ul>
				<li>
					This video I felt was the most important because it taught me how to setup a route to a webpage regardless of whether the page exists or not. This way, if a 
					user enters 
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<br/>
		</ol>
</p>

<h4><li>Do I feel like I learnt something in the entirety of this first session?</li></h4>
<p>
	I did feel like I had learnt something from this first lesson because I felt like I was able to do my own research and learn about an aspect of laravel that I was curious about 
	and not something that was scheduled to be taught. This way I could get more stuff done on my own and work at my own pace rather than at the lecturer's pace.
