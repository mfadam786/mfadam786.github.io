	<h4><li>Week 2 Lesson 2:</li></h4>
	<br/>
	<p>
		During this Friday session, I had learnt about user stories, what their purpose is and why they are needed when it comes to creating applications.
		<br/>
			<ol>
				<strong><li>Basic routing and views using laravel</li></strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							This video helped refresh my memory on how I would go about creating routes to different html pages using laravel. I learnt that routes are created within a web.php 
							file as references/pointers to the actual html file which is stored in a different location. This web.php file has knowledge of all the routes and when they are 
							requested by the user, laravel goes to the folder location in which the view is stored, finds it using the string name it has and pulls it up to be displayed.
						</li>
					</ul>
				<br/>
				<strong><li>Passing requests data to views</li></strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							This video was really useful because it taught me how to accept a request made by a user and pass it into the page's view so that is can be located and
							displayed to the respective page. This concept will become extremely useful in the future when I get into more complex web development requiring a user's input.
						</li>
					</ul>
				<br/>
				<strong><li>Route wildcards</li></strong>
				<ul>
					<li>
						I felt was the most important because it taught me how to setup a route to a webpage regardless of whether the page exists or not. This way, if a user enters an 
						invalid url, they are not met with an error that the page could not be found but instead can be redirected to a page that does exist and is valid.
					</li>
				</ul>

			</ol>
