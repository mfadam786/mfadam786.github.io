	<br/>
	<h5><li>Setting up of Github repository for upcoming project.</li></h5>
	<p>
		Because I have a group project coming up in a week or 2, this time was used to get into my respective group and create a repository for the upcoming task. My group and I had 
		created 6 different projects with 3 main questions that need to be asked at the end of each sprint (each sprint will be run over the course of 2 weeks):
		
		<ul>
			<li>What worked well and why it worked well?</li>
			<li>What could be improved?</li>
			<li>What will we commit to doing in the next sprint?</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>

		By asking these questions I am able to reflect on the ups and downs of the project on an ongoing basis so that I can figure out if things are going the way they should and 
		come up with effective strategies to improve/resolve any shortcomings if things are clearly not going well. This way any issues from the previous sprint can be ironed out before 
		the next sprint so that they don't creep up in the next sprint.

		<h5><li>Complete a basic CRUD application</li></h5>
		<p>
			In the last hour of the lesson, Grayson had given my group and I a task of creating a basic CRUD application which can used to create, read, update and delete content. This 
			sounded like it would be a really interesting challenge to see how well I could work within the group I had been assigned. I had created a brand new repository for this since
			it was just a task designed to gain an understanding of each of my group members' skills. I came up with the idea of creating a to-do list application in which a user can 
			note down their list of things that need to be done. This idea met the basis of the task we were given because a new task could be created, an existing task could be edited
			and a task could be deleted once completed. The reading aspect comes up when the user types in a new task into a field which is then read and created as a task to be done.

	<h4><li>How is this related to the 12 Agile principles?</li></h4>
	<p>
		I did feel like I had learnt something from this first lesson because I felt like I was able to do my own research and learn about an aspect of laravel that I was curious about 
		and not something that was scheduled to be taught. This way I could get more stuff done on my own and work at my own pace rather than at a lecturer's pace.
